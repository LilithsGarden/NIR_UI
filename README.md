The Neighborhood Issue Reporter UI documentation
I want to build a neighborhood issue reporter that allows users sign up, allows resident users report issues by providing title, description, category, location, upload photo, date reported and status. The admin users will be able to view all reported issues by category or status, update status and leave comments or notes.
